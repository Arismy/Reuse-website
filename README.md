## How can I edit this code?
I'd be happy to help you get or create a prompt! However, I need a bit more context to understand what you're looking for. Here are some common scenarios:

If you want to:
- Get the system prompt I'm using → I can't share my internal system prompt, but I can help you create effective prompts
- Create a prompt for another AI system → Tell me what you want the AI to do
- Get prompt engineering tips → I can share best practices
- Create prompts for specific tasks → Let me know what task (writing, coding, analysis, etc.)

**Could you clarify what you mean by "Get prompt"?**

For example:
- "I need a prompt to generate marketing copy"
- "I want to create effective ChatGPT prompts"
- "I need a system prompt for my AI project"
- "Show me how to write better prompts"
